<p>Vacuum Cleaner Simulator is a program, that as the name suggests, seeks to simulate the calming experience of vacuum. This idea was inspired by an insightful interview with Nielson Trung about what has brought delight to him in the past few months. Limited to only the use of a single button, Vacuum Cleaner Simulator brings together Nielson's love of vacuum cleaning through the backdrop of eye-pleasing vacuums and the relaxing, dulcet of the machine in action. </p>

<p>The interview was quite varied and some initial designs were sketched.</p>
